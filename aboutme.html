                        I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell Tech, gratefully advised by <a class="uline" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/">Prof. Vitaly Shmatikov</a>.
                        Broadly, my interests are somewhere in the (vast) union of machine learning, robustness, security, privacy, and fairness.
                        Nowadays, I'm mainly thinking about the <a class="uline" href="pubs/illusions.html">vulnerabilities</a> baked into modern encoders and embedding spaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW), where I was advised by <a class="uline" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/">Prof. Sewoong Oh</a>. 
                        My thesis, <a class="uline" href="pubs/label_poisoning.html"><em>Label Poisoning is All You Need</em></a> proposes a novel trajectory-matching-based backdoor attack, that corrupts (i.e., 'poisons') only the labels in a training set to create a highly-effective backdoor with an arbitrary trigger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before that, I received a B.S.B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics, Philosophy with <em>cum laude</em> and <em>&Phi;&Beta;&Kappa;</em> honors from UW.
                        During my stay, I was advised by <a class="uline" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/">Prof. Sewoong Oh</a>, <a href="https://www.rajeshpnrao.com/" class="uline">Prof. Rajesh Rao</a>, and <a href="https://spencersevilla.com/" class="uline">Spencer Sevilla</a>.
                        Additionally, I spent five summers working at Microsoft's Security and AI research group, building machine-learning detections for large-scale criminally-orchestrated attacks.
