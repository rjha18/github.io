                        I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University seeking to make the ML we rely on more robust, secure, private, and equitable from both a practical and theoretical lens.
                        I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I was advised by <a class="uline" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/">Prof. Sewoong Oh</a>. 
                        My thesis, <a href="label_poisoning.html"><em>Label Poisoning is All You Need</em></a> proposes a novel trajectory-matching-based backdoor attack, that corrupts (i.e., 'poisons') only the labels in a training set to create a highly-effective backdoor with an arbitrary trigger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously, I recieved a B.S.B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics, Philosophy with <em>cum laude</em> and <em>&Phi;&Beta;&Kappa;</em> honors from the University of Washington, Seattle.
                        During my stay, I was advised by <a class="uline" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/">Prof. Sewoong Oh</a>, <a href="https://www.rajeshpnrao.com/" class="uline">Prof. Rajesh Rao</a>, and <a href="https://spencersevilla.com/" class="uline">Spencer Sevilla</a>.
                        Additionally, I spent five summers working at Microsoft's Security and AI research group, building machine-learning detections for large-scale criminally-orchestrated attacks.
